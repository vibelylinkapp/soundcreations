<p>We were honoured to deliver a comprehensive audio solution at CITAM Buruburu, tailored to the demands of a dynamic worship environment with clarity, power and precision.</p>
<h2>Front of house</h2>
<p>A full-range dB Technologies T-Series system (T12 and T8) delivers powerful, consistent sound across the main auditorium.</p>
<h2>Subwoofers</h2>
<p>dB Technologies S30 dual 18-inch subwoofers handle the low end, delivering impactful bass for both speech and music.</p>
<h2>Under-balcony fills</h2>
<p>dB Technologies IG1 speakers maintain coverage and clarity in the under-balcony seating areas.</p>
<h2>Stage monitors</h2>
<p>dB Technologies FMX15 monitors provide clear, powerful foldback for the worship team.</p>
<h2>Audio control</h2>
<p>At the heart of the system, an Allen &amp; Heath Avantis digital mixing console offers flexible, intuitive control and reliable performance for both live and broadcast applications.</p>
<p>This installation reflects our commitment to delivering scalable, high-quality audio-visual systems that elevate the worship experience.</p>

<p>"We have good sound! I can't believe our church sound system could sound so good." Those were the words that met Sound Creations on the visit to certify the completed acoustic treatment at P.C.E.A. Chuka, in Meru.</p>
<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>The Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) sanctuary in Chuka had suffered from poor acoustics for years. The single-level, T-shaped building was finished in hard materials - a terrazzo floor, natural-stone walls and the exposed underside of an iron-sheet roof on steel trusses - creating a highly reverberant space that destroyed speech clarity. Reverberation-time measurements recorded up to 3.77 seconds at 125 Hz and an average of 3.32 seconds at mid frequencies (500-1,000 Hz), far above the 1.22 seconds recommended for intelligibility in a space of that volume.</p>
<h2>Design and installation</h2>
<p>To bring the reverberation time down, Sound Creations installed 740 square metres of Rockfon Artic stone-wool acoustic ceiling panels, suspended a minimum of 200 mm below the existing ceiling and following its slope. Rockfon Artic combines high sound absorption with fire protection, thermal insulation, humidity and microorganism resistance, and excellent light reflection.</p>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p>Post-installation measurements confirmed the reverberation time at mid frequencies had dropped from 3.3 seconds to 1.1 seconds - exactly as predicted - transforming speech intelligibility. The church also gained improved aesthetics, better thermal comfort and a brighter, more light-filled sanctuary. The committee expressed great satisfaction with the results.</p>
